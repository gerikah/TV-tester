>>> TV Class and Test Driver Program

This program implements a Python class named `TV` based on the given UML Class Diagram. The `TV` class represents a television and provides various methods to control its channel, volume, and power status. Additionally, a test driver program named `test_TV` is included to demonstrate the functionality of the `TV` class.

> TestTV Program

The `test_TV` program demonstrates the usage of the `TV` class by creating two `TV` objects and producing the specified output.

> Output

The program will output the following:

```
tv1's channel is 30 and volume level is 3
tv2's channel is 3 and volume level is 2
```

This output corresponds to the specific initialization and method calls made in the `test_TV` program.

Note: The TV class and the TestTV program are implemented in separate Python files, as explained below.

> Files

1. `TV.py`: Contains the implementation of the `TV` class.
2. `test_TV.py`: Contains the implementation of the `test_TV` program.

> Running the Program

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download both `tv.py` and `test_tv.py` files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the downloaded files are located.
4. Run the `test_tv.py` program by executing the following command:

   ```
   python test_tv.py
   ```

5. The output specified above should be displayed in the terminal or command prompt.

Note: Make sure both `tv.py` and `test_tv.py` files are present in the same directory before executing the command.
